Hi Professor Lee,

Sorry I did not use VSCode or commit regularly. I developed my code using Notepad++ and did not have a way to commit using it besides reuploading. Hopefully you can see that I wrote it myself, and I understand the topics that you have taught us. If you have any questions or concerns, my email is dachapin@zonemail.clpccd.edu.

Thanks,
Dan Chapin
